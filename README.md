This repository is meant for storing all code snippets that pertain to my project at HBCSE, TIFR and form a part of my Practice School component.
The project involves the use of Elasticsearch to create an efficient search engine for the GStudio data repository. A Django project named Searcheng with the application Esearch has been created for this purpose. All interactions with Elasticsearch are carried out via a low-level python client, elasticsearch-py.
